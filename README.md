# Graduation project 
### The purpose of the project:
* To get an idea of how ASP.NET Core MVC development looks.
***
This project describes an application close to the real world - an online store. 
The FoodDeliveryShop app is created using the classic approach of online stores around the world.
***
### The store has: 
1. An online catalog of products that customers can browse by category and page. 
2. A basket in which users can add and delete products. 
3. Checking when customers can enter their delivery details. 
4. An administration area that includes tools for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) for
directory management. Url type /Admin/Index & /Order/List give access to editing orders and products.
5. Data protection so that only registered administrators can make changes.
The project simplified integration with external systems, such as a database, and completely eliminated the payment process.
6. Unit tests for testing complex and important parts of the application.
***
### Application deployment:
* After building the store, I started researching the question of deploying the application on 2 operating systems: Windows and Linux.
